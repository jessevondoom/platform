Elements bundle unique workflows in the CASH Music platform. Think of them as apps accessing
the core the same way apps access APIs on a phone. We took inspiration from app stores in
the idea of creating a simple bundle that's easy to use and configure.

Each element has a PHP class that follows a set pattern, mustache templates for markup, an
image for thumbs, a LICENSE, and an accompanying JSON definition file. The rest is handled 
automatically. All settings forms are generated by the admin app itself (and could even be 
set manually from PHP if you feel like going gusto.)

The main element class defines and responds to various states â€” usually triggered by GET or
POST request via embed. The element listens for its own id and reacts to all matching CASH 
Responses. 

An element is embedded with a single function call, and will respond automatically when 
interacted with. The whole idea being that it's a simple to use structure that can be powerful 
and flexible enough to innovate on top of the PHP core.
