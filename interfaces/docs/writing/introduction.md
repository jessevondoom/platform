The CASH Music platform gives all musicians access to tools that let them manage, 
promote, and sell their music online â€” all owned and controlled themselves.

Everything is modular. We built up around a PHP core. The admin app, API, and each
element are separate applications that work together to form a full platform. We've 
built around the concept of cooperation, so we've abstracted all third party services
so artists can easily change mailing providers, payment processors, etc. And we've kept
dependencies as lightweight as possible so functionality can play well with other 
apps like WordPress, Drupal, etc.

We host a free (now and forever) version of the CASH Music platform at **cashmusic.org** 
or the whole thing can be downloaded and installed on your own server. A few simple 
changes to settings switch the platform from single-user mode to mutli-user (hosted)
mode. 

In short: the CASH Music platform was built to create possibilies for artists on the
open web.

In these docs we'll cover:

 * Working directly with the PHP Core
 * Our APIs (verbose and RESTful)
 * Defining connections to third party services
 * Building elements (custom workflow for embeds)
 * Working with our admin app
