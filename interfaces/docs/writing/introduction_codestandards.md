When in doubt, code for legibility and easy adoption. Capitalization and CamelCase should be used 
for class names, camelCase starting with lowercase for function names, and variable names in 
snake_case (lowercase and underscores.) Indentation has been kept simple â€” a single hard tab 
for each level, with curly brackets on the same line as the control statement.

So a simplified file will look something like:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jessevondoom/eba22b3420410cf10724.js"></script> 

Each class should have a file of it's own.

No class is final without formatted comments.
